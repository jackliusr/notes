\section{Integers, Rational Numbers and Real Numbers}

\subsection{Negative Numbers, Positive Numbers and Integers}
\textbf{Negative numbers} are numbers with negative sign(-). For example, -1,
-2, -3.6 and - \(\frac 1 2 \) are negative numbers.

\textbf{Positive numbers} are numbers with positive sign(+) or without any sign.

\textbf{Integers} are the numbers ...,-3,-2,-1,0,1,2,3,...
\begin{enumerate}
\item Integers that are greater than zero are known as \textbf{positive
    integers}
\item Integers that are less than zero are known as \textbf{negative integers}
\end{enumerate}
Notice: Integers comprises of the number zero, 0 and all positive numbers and
negative numbers that are whole numbers.

Common mistake:
It is wrong to say that all positive and negative numbers are integers. Not all
positive and negative numbers are whole numbers. However, it is correct to say
that all integers are whole numbers.

A number line can be used to show the order of numbers. On a horizontal number
line,
\begin{enumerate}
\item all positive numbers are positioned to the right of zero.
\item all negative numbers are positioned to the left of zero,
\item numbers are arranged in ascending order from left to right,
\item every number is greater than the number(s) on its left and less than the
  number(s) on its right.
  
\end{enumerate}

The symbol \textless , \textgreater ,  \(\leq\), and \(\geq\) are called \textbf{inequality signs}.
\begin{center}
  \begin{tabular}{| c| l |  }
    \hline
    Inequality Signs & Meaning \\ 
    \hline
    \textless & Less than \\  
    \hline
    \textgreater  & Greater than \\   
    \hline

    \(\leq \) & Less than and equal to \\   
    \hline
    \(\geq \) & Greater than and equal to \\   
    \hline
  \end{tabular}
\end{center}

\subsection{Addition and Subtraction of Integers}

Addition of a \textbf{positive number} refers to a movement to the \textbf{right} of a
number line.

Addition of a \textbf{negative number} refers to a movement to the \textbf{left}
of a number line.

Subtraction of a \textbf{positive number} refers to movement to the
\textbf{left} of a number line.

Subtraction of a \textbf{negative number} refers to a movement to the
\textbf{right} of a number line.

Notice: Given that a \textgreater b,
\begin{itemize}
\item \(a + (-b) = a - b \)
\item \((-a) +b = -(a - b)\)
\item \((-b)+ a = a -b\)
\item \((-a)+(-b)= -(a+b)\)
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Multiplication, Division, and Combined Operations of Integers}
\subsubsection{Rules of multiplying integers:}
\begin{enumerate}
\item \((+a) \times (+b) = +(a \times b)\)  
\item \((-a) \times (-b) = +(a \times b)\) 
\item \((+a) \times (-b) = -(a \times b)\)
\item \((-a) \times (+b) = -(a \times b) \)

\end{enumerate}


\subsubsection{Rules of dividing integers}
\begin{enumerate}
\item \((+a) \div (+b) = + ( a \div b)\)
\item \((-a) \div (-b) = +(a \div b)\)
\item \((+a) \div (-b) = - (a \div b)\)
\item \((-a) \div (+b) = -(a \div b)\)
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{Steps for performing combined operations of integers}
\begin{enumerate}
\item If there is more than 1 part of brackets, always evaluate the expression
  in the innermost pair of brackets first.
\item After which, if there are any indices, evaluate them
\item Then perform multiplication and division from left to right.
\item Finally, perform addition and subtraction from left to right.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Rational Numbers}

A \textbf{rational number} is a number that can be expressed as a fraction
\(\frac a b\), where a and b are integers and b \(\neq\)=0.

Rules of adding or subtraction rational numbers:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Express the given rational numbers as equaivalent fractions with the
  \textbf{same denominator} before performing addition and subtraction.
\item Apply the rules of addition or subtraction of integers.
\end{enumerate}


Rules of multiplying or dividing two rational numbers, \(\frac a b \) and
\(\frac c d\):

\begin{enumerate}
  \item \({\frac a b} \times {\frac c d} = {\frac {a \times c } {b \times d}}\),
    where \(\frac a b\) and \(\frac c d\) are 2 rational numbers, \(b \neq 0, c
    \neq 0\).
 \item \({\frac a b} \div {\frac c d } = {\frac a b } \times {\frac d c} =
   {\frac {a \times d} {b \times c}}\)
\end{enumerate}

Each \textbf{positive} number, \(x\), has a \textbf{positive} square root
\(\sqrt x\) and a \textbf{negative} square root \(- \sqrt x\). For example,
16 has a square root of 4 and -4 because 16 = 4 x 4 and 16=(-4)x(-4).
