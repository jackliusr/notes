          durability SLIs: the data that the user wants may be only a small portion of the data that is
          stored. For example, if you have 1 billion records for the previous 10 years, but the user wants
          only the records from today (which are unavailable), then they will be unhappy even though
          almost all of their data is readable.</p></td>
